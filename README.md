# ToxicRAT
This tool allows one to execute commands to someone else's computer remotely. Currently it can only execute the basic shell commands.

# How it works:
The ToxicServer.py script will make it's host computer a server that the ToxicClient.py will connect to when run. After the connection
has been established the server will be able to execute different commands to the client.
